# Fetal Health Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts fetal health conditions (Normal, Suspect, Pathological)
from CTG features using a trained ML model and a Streamlit web interface.

## Project Structure
- model/: Trained model saved as fetal_model.pkl
- data/: Dataset (optional reference)
- app/: Streamlit web app
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for model training and testing

## Run the app
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Navigate to app folder: `cd app`
3. Run: `streamlit run fetal_health_app.py`
